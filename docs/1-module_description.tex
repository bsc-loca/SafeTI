\subsection{Module description}
\label{module_desc}
This unit acts as an AHB/AXI Master IP connected to the main bus on the SELENE Platform. It acts as a core with limited capabilities, only generating transactions to the bus by reading and writing to the AHB Slave RAM memory and controlled via APB registers.\\
The injector works along with the multi-core setup instantiated on the platform and other peripherals and monitoring units.\\
The module's specifications described in this section include non-implemented features, and it might be revisited for future improvements.\\
In order to generate traffic to the bus, the module performs a set of data transactions based on descriptors set at startup into a predefined memory address range.\\
The Traffic Injector is based on generic Direct Memory Access functionality fundamentals and extends its features to meet the injector objectives.\\
The internal components and respective configuration and functionalities are described in next sections.
