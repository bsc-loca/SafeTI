\section{Designing software for traffic generation and control}
\label{software}

The SafeTI IP includes bare-metal drivers located on \verb|bsc\_inj/sw| project folder, providing the foundation for the injection program the user is designing. 
It is required that both files \textbf{injector.c} and \textbf{injector.h} are included on the main program that uses the injector calls, usually as library files.

This section supposes that the SafeTI is already implemented on the desired platform, meaning it has a fixed \textbf{INJ\_BASE\_ADDR}, which is the base address 
where the injector is allocated as an APB Slave component. This parameter must be updated accordingly on the \textbf{injector.h} file, so the calls are executed 
on the memory space the injector is allocated. In the case the \textbf{INJ\_BASE\_ADDR} is unknown, refer to section \fullref{} for further information.

The following section \fullref{software-drivers} presents the available calls by default on the drivers used to design an injection program.
However, they're limited in scope, thus, section \fullref{software-baremetal} provides the required information to expand the drivers at the user desire.
