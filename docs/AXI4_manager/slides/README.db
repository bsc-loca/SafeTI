The slides present on this folder are originally made in LibreOffice Impress (.odp). 
However, it has been exported to .pdf and .pptx so other tools may open them, even though they may fail to show correctly.

The "Outdated 0.7 Manager Interface slides" presentation may be useful to understand internal parts of the interface or for a basic explaination of the AXI protocol, but take into account it may not represent the actual state of the interface.
