\section{Error Handling}
The module provides a very detailed way to detect and debug errors while enabled. Status register of the APB I/F has a general error flag that is raised if a misbehavior has been detected.

\begin{itemize}
 	\item \textbf{DE}: Decode Error can occur during the decoding of a descriptor if the type of descriptor is not valid.
  	\item \textbf{RE}: Read descriptor Error will be flagged in case when the Master Bus I/F receives an error response during a descriptor read burst.
	\item \textbf{RDE}: If the Bus Master receives an error during any part of the read access performed as part of the Memory to Controller, RDE will be flagged.
	\item \textbf{WDE}: If the Bus Master receives an error during any part of the write access performed as part of the Controller to Memory transaction, WDE will be flagged.
	\item \textbf{NPE}: Defines the Next Pointer Error when the Bus Master receives an error while switching to the next descriptor address.
\end{itemize}

In case of an error, or if the Injector has completed the execution of the entire queue, it will stay on an Idle state and clear the ONG bit. 
CMP will be set to one if no errors occurred and the descriptors queue is done.
