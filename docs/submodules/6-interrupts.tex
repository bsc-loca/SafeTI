\section{Interrupts}

This module provides interrupt on error and interrupt on descriptor completion. The general interrupt flag is controlled via de CTRL APB register of the Injector. 
You could also enable the Error Interrupts from the CTRL register. The On-Completion Interrupt is set when configuring the descriptor at the CTRL Data Descriptor control word.
