# Safe Traffic Injector
The Safe Traffic Injector (SafeTI for short) unit acts as an AHB or AXI4 Manager IP connected to the main AMBA bus. It functions as a core with limited capabilities, only generating transactions to the bus by reading and writing to memory address and controlled via APB registers. The injector works along with the multi-core setup instantiated on the platform and other peripherals and monitoring units. In order to generate traffic to the bus, the module must be first programmed with a series of descriptors describing the traffic pattern to be injected. Then, once the SafeTI module is configured and enabled, it performs a set of AMBA transactions based on the programmed data descriptors into a predefined memory address range.

## Description
The core components of the SafeTI IP are designed in VHDL without any external dependencies, allowing implementation at other platform provided a compatible interface to the target interconnect. In this matter, the SafeTI has been integrated on an instance of the SELENE platform at both AHB and AXI4 networks. Component wrappers that can be used as templates are presented within the ```hdl/platform_wrappers``` directory, where the ```injector_core``` is instanced with a platform's AHB interface or a custom AXI4 interface on their respective implementation cases.
A high-level block diagram of the module is shown, its internal components and respective configuration and functionalities are described.

## Descriptors
Descriptors are used to define, control, and monitor transactions generated by the Traffic Injector. Descriptor types supported by this module can be classified, as of today, as read, write and delay descriptors. Furthermore, each transaction type has unique programmable **size**, **number of iterative executions**, among other parameters for describing the access pattern to generate.

These descriptors are programmed, by 32-bit word steps and in execution order, through the **Descriptor Input Feed** register from the APB subordinate allocation, which are transmitted to be stored at the internal **Descriptor Buffer**. These will be fetched, decoded and executed through the 3-stage pipeline once the SafeTI module is enabled and configured at the **Control Register**.

These operations are supported for bare-metal execution by the included drivers from the ```sw``` directory, which include commentaries with instructions. For more information regarding the use of the Module, see [Specifications](docs/Injector_Specs/SafeTI_manual.pdf) [Document WIP].
